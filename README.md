##Keylogger
 
 Keylogger is a project designed to demonstrate how keystrokes can be recorded from a computer or other digital device. This project includes both software-based and hardware-based implementations. Keyloggers can be utilized for a range of legitimate    purposes, such as security monitoring, user behavior research, and system debugging.
